we'll start off the first one with the familiar; python/pygame

-the dragon is dressed as a princess and crying out for help in its tower atop a little "vw beetle" car
-the moose is cool af and smokes and has shades and drives a race car and the gameplay should be somewhat
akin to that of a road rage game like Death Skid Marks
-the bad guy would then ironically be the princess (dressed in really evil-looking, bad-guy attire?)
-sidescroller or topdown?
-jump right into the game (learn the basics of play through a couple "easy" levels)
-at some point have the backstory explained
-backstory: you view the life of the moose (skipping past his inception) starting somewhere in his time as a newborn to adulthood
-along the way the princess motives are explained (the dragon killed and ate her prince charming)
the intro scene:
(cuteness + lullaby music) <first baby in crib shot>
aged a bit
his parents try to make him jump as hes just a crawling moose
they are concerned when he cannot
he grows older, the other moose kids get really good at jumping (theyre jumping-moose)
he remains bad at jumping 
his frustration continues into his teenage years as the moose around him become fully matured jumpers (again; theyre jumping-moose)
but toward the start of his adult life he grows to accept it, even when others point out his inadequacies and make fun of him he gets on with it (with the occasional tantrum)
on a berry picking trip he gets lost in the woods
day turns to dusk turns to night and things start to get scary for the little moose
something approaches in the dark
a massive roar is heard in the distance
the thing ever approaching
blammm its a dragon
oh but it just collided with the moose as it was running from something aswell (which it conveys to the moose in a very panicking fashion)
the moose consoles it and hands it some berries (after the dragons stomach makes light of its hunger through a sort of creaking noise)
it loves berries!
they eat loads of berries 
the dragon sets a tree ablaze (as a nice little "fire")
they sit side by side eating more berries and discussing
dragon gives moose hug
night turns to day and the dragon takes moose flying 
oh the joy moose feels finally reaching high places
higher than he'd ever been or wanted to be
higher than any moose had ever jumped
they set down at a cliff by the sea
they fall in love
they fly back to moose village
when they get back everyone makes fun of moose for dating a dragon
dragon spits fire at them
moose smiles
skip to them getting married
enter princess
she wedding crashes (literally (have a moose with a dumb look on his face holding a sign "wedding crasher" at the princess) she crashes into it with her car) 
multiple jumping moose die in the horrible "accident"
she leaps at dragon
captures dragon with chain around mouth and wings
takes dragon into car
drives off
moose follows
in his awesome race car right next to the wedding scene
puts on shades cuz why not
arrive
princess throws dragon into tower
deadlifts tower onto her car (moose gets funny look (big eyes (honky horn sound?)))
moose goes to tower tries to open door, cant
looks up at the balcony, realizing he cant jump that high
tries anyway
fails
cue princess manaiacal laugh
she gets in car
drives off
moose gets in car
follows"""
